# House-Price-Prediction

This project is about predicting the house prices in Iowa using Python and Machine Learning algorithms.

Below are some of the highlights of this project:

● Housing datasets are explored and analyzed in detail to find the key features that influenced the sales price of the houses

● Machine Learning algorithms are developed to predict the house prices

● Feature Importance is examined using Lasso Regression and Random Forest Regression and various factors affecting the prices of houses are determined
